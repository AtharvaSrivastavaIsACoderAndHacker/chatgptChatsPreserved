## Introduction to Forces

A **force** is defined as any interaction that changes or tends to change the motion of an object. Force is a vector quantity characterized by magnitude and direction. In classical mechanics, forces cause acceleration — change in velocity — according to Newton's laws.

### Mathematical Definition

$$
\vec{F} = m \vec{a}
$$

Where:  
- $\vec{F}$ is the net force vector (measured in Newtons, N)  
- $m$ is the inertial mass (kilograms, kg)  
- $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration vector (meters per second squared, m/s²)

**Newton (N)** is defined as the force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass by 1 m/s²:

$$
1 \, \text{N} = 1 \, \text{kg} \cdot 1\, \text{m/s}^2
$$

### Conceptual Understanding

- Forces arise from **interactions**:  
  - *Contact forces* require physical touching (e.g., friction, tension).  
  - *Non-contact forces* act at a distance (e.g., gravity, electromagnetic).  
- A force vector changes an object's velocity vector, thus altering speed and/or direction. This is formalized as acceleration.

## Types of Forces: In-Depth

### 1. Contact Forces

These forces occur through direct physical interaction between objects.

#### a) Normal Force ($F_N$)

- Acts **perpendicular** to the surfaces in contact.
- Balances components of other forces (usually gravity) to prevent penetration.
  
**Example:**  
Consider a book resting on a table. The Earth exerts a downward gravitational force on the book:

$$
F_g = mg
$$

where $g \approx 9.8 \, m/s^2$ is acceleration due to gravity.

The table exerts an upward normal force $F_N$ equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, resulting in static equilibrium:

$$
F_N = mg
$$

If these two forces are balanced, the net force is zero, and the book remains at rest.

#### b) Friction ($f$)

Friction opposes relative motion or attempted motion between surfaces.

- **Static friction ($f_s$):** Prevents motion up to a maximum value:

$$
f_s \leq \mu_s F_N
$$

where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction. The inequality means static friction adjusts up to a limit.

- **Kinetic friction ($f_k$):** Acts during sliding motion, typically less than static friction:

$$
f_k = \mu_k F_N, \quad \mu_k < \mu_s
$$

**Example:**  
Pushing a heavy box initially requires overcoming static friction. Once it starts sliding, kinetic friction applies, often requiring less force.

---

#### c) Tension ($T$)

- Transmitted through ropes, cables, or strings.
- Acts along the length of the object, pulling at both ends.

**Example:**  
Elevator cables apply tension force to lift or lower the cabin. The tension force changes dynamically depending on acceleration and mass.

---

#### d) Spring Force ($F_s$)

Hooke's law describes the restoring force of an ideal spring:

$$
F_s = -kx
$$

where:  
- $k$ is the spring constant (N/m), a measure of stiffness.  
- $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium (m).  
- The negative sign indicates the force acts opposite the displacement, restoring equilibrium.

**Example:**  
Compressing a spring by 0.05 m with a spring constant of 200 N/m produces:

$$
F_s = - (200)(0.05) = -10 \, \text{N}
$$

This restoring force pushes back toward equilibrium.

---

#### e) Applied Force ($F_{app}$)

- External force applied by agents (human push, machine, wind).
- Can vary dynamically.

---

### 2. Non-Contact Forces

Operate without physical contact, often modeled as fields.

#### a) Gravitational Force ($F_g$)

Universal law of gravitation, between two masses $m_1$, $m_2$ separated by distance $r$:

$$
F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

Where $G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$ is the gravitational constant.

- Force is always attractive.
- Acts along the line connecting masses.

---

#### b) Electric Force ($F_e$)

By Coulomb’s Law for point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$:

$$
F_e = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
$$

Where $k_e = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}^2$.

- Force is repulsive if charges have the same sign; attractive if opposite.

---

#### c) Magnetic Force ($F_m$)

On a charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ in magnetic field $\vec{B}$:

$$
\vec{F}_m = q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}
$$

- Direction given by the right-hand rule.
- Magnitude depends on charge, velocity, and magnetic field strength.

---

## Effects of Force

Forces produce:

- **Acceleration:** Change in velocity vector ($\vec{a}$).
- **Deformation:** Elastic or plastic change in shape or size.
- **Motion Change:** Start, stop, or change direction.

---

## Galileo's Concept of Inertia

Galileo experimentally demonstrated that an object in motion remains in motion unless acted on by an external force, opposing Aristotle’s idea that motion requires continuous force.

### Inertia

- The **tendency** of an object to resist changes in its motion.
- Quantified by **mass**: higher mass → higher inertia.

---

## Newton’s Laws of Motion

### First Law: Law of Inertia

An object will maintain its state of rest or uniform velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.

- Defines **inertial frames of reference**.
- Explains why friction eventually stops moving objects—friction is an external force.

**Example:**  
A puck on frictionless ice slides indefinitely with constant velocity.

---

### Second Law: $ \vec{F} = m \vec{a} $, Impulse-Momentum

Force equals rate of change of momentum $\vec{p} = m \vec{v}$:

$$
\vec{F}_{net} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
$$

If mass is constant:

$$
\vec{F}_{net} = m \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m \vec{a}
$$

#### Impulse-Momentum Theorem

Impulse $\vec{J}$ over interval $\Delta t$ changes momentum:

$$
\vec{J} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \vec{F} dt = \Delta \vec{p} = m \Delta \vec{v}
$$

- Increasing the impact time $\Delta t$ reduces average force.
- Example: Car crumple zones extend collision time to reduce injury force.

**Example Problem:**  
A 10 kg block experiences a 50 N applied force and 10 N friction force opposing.

Calculate net force and acceleration:

$$
F_{net} = 50\, \text{N} - 10\, \text{N} = 40\, \text{N}
$$

$$
a = \frac{F_{net}}{m} = \frac{40}{10} = 4\, m/s^2
$$

---

### Third Law: Action-Reaction Pairs

For every force exerted by object 1 on object 2 ($\vec{F}_{12}$), there is an equal and opposite force exerted by object 2 on object 1 ($\vec{F}_{21}$):

$$
\vec{F}_{12} = -\vec{F}_{21}
$$

**Example:**  
A rocket expels gas backward; the gas pushes the rocket forward with equal magnitude force.

---

## Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation

$$
F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
$$

- Governs planetary and satellite orbits.
- Force is attractive along the line connecting the centers of mass.

### Gravitational Acceleration

Acceleration due to Earth’s gravity at surface:

$$
g = \frac{GM}{R^2} \approx 9.8 \, m/s^2
$$

Where:  
- $M$ = Earth mass  
- $R$ = Earth radius
