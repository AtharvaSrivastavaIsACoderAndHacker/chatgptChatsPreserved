# üß† DEEP DIVE: MOMENTUM & RELATED CONCEPTS

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. What is Momentum?

### üîπ Formal Definition:
\[
\vec{p} = m \cdot \vec{v}
\]

- **Momentum** \( \vec{p} \): A vector quantity (has both magnitude and direction).
- **Mass** \( m \): Scalar (kg)
- **Velocity** \( \vec{v} \): Vector (m/s)

### üîπ Intuition:
- Think of momentum as **‚Äúinertia in motion.‚Äù**
- A large mass at high velocity (like a truck) is harder to stop than a small mass moving slowly.

---

## üîπ 2. Newton‚Äôs Second Law and Momentum

The standard form is:
\[
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m \cdot \vec{a}
\]

But acceleration is the **rate of change of velocity**, and since momentum is \( \vec{p} = m \vec{v} \), we can write:
\[
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
\]

### ‚úÖ General Form of Newton's Second Law:
\[
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
\]

- For **constant mass**, this simplifies to \( m \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m\vec{a} \).
- For **variable mass systems** (like rockets), we must use \( \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} \) as is.

## üöÄ 3. Impulse-Momentum Theorem

Impulse is defined as the integral of force over time:
\[
\vec{J} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \vec{F}_{\text{net}}(t) \, dt
\]

From Newton's 2nd Law:
\[
\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}
\Rightarrow \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \vec{F}_{\text{net}}(t) \, dt = \Delta \vec{p}
\]

### ‚úÖ Impulse-Momentum Theorem:
\[
\vec{J} = \Delta \vec{p} = \vec{p}_{\text{final}} - \vec{p}_{\text{initial}}
\]

### üî∏ Physical Meaning:
- A force applied over time causes a change in momentum.
- Stronger force or longer time ‚Üí bigger momentum change.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è 4. Law of Conservation of Momentum

### üîπ Statement:
> In a closed, isolated system (no external net force), the total momentum of the system remains constant.

\[
\sum \vec{p}_{\text{initial}} = \sum \vec{p}_{\text{final}}
\]

### üî∏ Why It Works:
- From Newton‚Äôs third law (action = ‚Äìreaction), internal forces cancel.
- If \( \vec{F}_{\text{net}} = 0 \), then \( \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = 0 \Rightarrow \vec{p} = \text{constant} \).

---

## üí• 5. Types of Collisions

### (i) Elastic Collision
- Both **momentum** and **kinetic energy** are conserved.

### (ii) Inelastic Collision
- Momentum conserved, **kinetic energy not conserved**.

### (iii) Perfectly Inelastic Collision
- Maximum energy loss.
- Objects stick together after collision.

---

## üß™ 6. 1D and 2D Collision Equations

### For 1D:
\[
m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2
\]

- Use kinetic energy conservation if **elastic**:
\[
\frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2
\]

### For 2D:
- Conserve momentum in **both x and y directions**:
\[
\sum p_{x,\text{initial}} = \sum p_{x,\text{final}}, \quad
\sum p_{y,\text{initial}} = \sum p_{y,\text{final}}
\]

---

## üöó 7. Center of Mass and Momentum

In a multi-particle system:
- The **total momentum** of the system = **total mass √ó velocity of center of mass (COM)**

\[
\vec{p}_{\text{total}} = M \cdot \vec{v}_{\text{COM}}
\]

- If **no external force**, the **COM moves at constant velocity**.

---

## üß© 8. Applications of Momentum Concepts

- **Rocket propulsion**: based on conservation of momentum (Tsiolkovsky rocket equation).
- **Recoil**: gun momentum = bullet momentum (opposite direction).
- **Car crashes**: Impulse helps design crumple zones (longer time ‚Üí less force).
- **Sports**: Kicking a ball, hitting a bat ‚Äî all involve impulse and momentum.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è 10. Cosmic Energy and Momentum Flow: Sunlight to Motion

Photons from the Sun carry energy \( E = h\nu \) and momentum \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). When they strike a leaf:

1. A **small amount of photon momentum is transferred** (radiation pressure).
2. **Photon energy is absorbed** and used in **photosynthesis** to generate glucose.
3. Glucose stores **chemical energy** used by organisms.
4. When food is eaten, energy is metabolized to produce **ATP**.
5. ATP drives **muscle contractions**, which generate **mechanical force and motion**.
6. Muscles apply force over time ‚Üí **impulse** ‚Üí generates new **momentum**.

### üîπ Final Insight:
The **momentum output in human motion** is not a return of the original photon momentum, but it **originates from the energy those photons carried**. While exact momentum vectors aren't preserved, **conservation laws govern each step**: energy is transformed, and momentum is conserved in all interactions. This entire causal chain connects **sunlight to biological motion** via energy and momentum principles.

## üìå 11. Summary: What to Intuitively Remember

- Momentum is how much "oomph" an object has.
- It depends linearly on both mass and velocity.
- Impulse = "how much push over how much time".
- Momentum is always conserved in **closed systems**.
- Kinetic energy is **not always** conserved, especially in inelastic collisions.
- Newton‚Äôs 2nd Law in its most fundamental form is about **momentum**, not just acceleration.
- The universe operates under these conservation laws from the quantum to cosmic scale ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a photon hitting a leaf or a sprinter accelerating on the track.
